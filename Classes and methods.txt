-Method overriding => 
{
	-We can override a virtual or abstract inherited method.
}
-Abstract classes and members => 
{
	-Indicates that it's missing implementation.
	-If a member is abstract, the containing class needs to be declared as abstract too.
	-The derived classes MUST implement all abstract members with the method OVERRIDING.
	-Abstract classes CAN'T be instantiated.
	-Used to provide common behaviour while forcing the development to follow a particular design.
}
-Sealed classes and memebers => 
{
	-The opposite of abstract.
	-Prevents the derivation of classes or overriding of methods.
	-Are faster because of some run-time optimizations.
